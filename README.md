# Digital PA System for the Singapore Book Council

## Introduction

This prototype introduces a cost-effective digital personal assistant (PA) system designed to help administrators at the Singapore Book Council efficiently arrange and schedule meetings, automate tasks, and improve overall productivity.

## Problem Statement

Administrators often face challenges in managing their daily tasks, including scheduling meetings, sending follow-up emails, setting reminders, and staying organized with email threads. These manual processes can be time-consuming and prone to errors.

## Solution

This digital PA system addresses these challenges by providing a user-friendly interface to automate various administrative tasks. It leverages technologies like Python, SQLite, and natural language processing to offer the following key features:

### 1. Meeting Arrangement and Scheduling

- **Calendar:** View and manage personal and shared events in a calendar format.
- **Event Creation:** Easily create new events with details like name, date, time, and shared users.
- **Event Deletion:** Delete unwanted events from the calendar.

### 2. Task Automation

- **Reminders:** Set reminders for important tasks with options for email notifications and sharing with others.
- **Follow-up tasks:** Schedule automated follow-up tasks to be sent to yourself or others.
- **Email Summarisation:** Generate concise summaries of lengthy email threads to save time and improve understanding.

### 3. Secure User Management

- **Login and Registration:** Secure user authentication system with password protection.
- **Shared access:** Control access to events and reminders by sharing them with specific users.

## Key Components and Functionalities

# 1. Database Management

Databases Used:

users.db: Stores user credentials securely.

events.db: Stores event and calendar data.

emails.db: Stores email summaries and related data.

The use of separate databases ensures secure and efficient data management, preventing conflicts between different types of information.

# 2. User Interface (UI)

Built using Tkinter to provide an intuitive and interactive experience for administrators.

Incorporates user-friendly components such as dropdowns, calendar views, and dynamic forms for event creation.

# 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Leverages the Hugging Face Transformers library for email summarization, making it easier for administrators to extract essential information from email threads quickly.

# 4. Email Notification System

Provides an option to send email reminders.

Administrators can configure email settings using their credentials. For Gmail users, app-specific passwords are required for security.

**How the components address the problem:**

- The **UI** simplifies user interaction, making it easy to create, manage, and view events and reminders.
- The **database** securely stores all data, ensuring easy access and management for administrators.
- **NLP** enables the automation of email summarization, saving time and improving information retrieval.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.7+

- Libraries:

	- tkinter (standard library in Python)

	- tkcalendar (Install via pip install tkcalendar)

	- sqlite3 (standard library in Python)

	- transformers (Install via pip install transformers for NLP functionalities)


## Benefits

- **Increased Efficiency:** Automate tedious tasks to free up administrators' time.
- **Improved Productivity:** Focus on core tasks instead of manual administrative processes.
- **Reduced Errors:** Minimize human errors in scheduling, follow-ups, and reminders.
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** Easily share events and reminders with other users.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with other platforms like Google Calendar and email clients.
- Advanced reminder functionalities with location-based triggers and custom notification settings.
- AI-powered task suggestions based on user activity and preferences.

## Conclusion

This cost-effective digital PA system offers a comprehensive solution for administrators at the Singapore Book Council to streamline their workflows, improve efficiency, and enhance productivity. It tackles common challenges faced in managing administrative tasks, allowing administrators to focus on strategic initiatives and contribute to the council's goals.
